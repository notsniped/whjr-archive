This is a repository made by notsniped (the founder of the [NKA Organization](https://github.com/PyBotDevs)) for WhiteHat Jr **Advanced** students to help them with their web coding projects.

## Why Do This?
I am a WhiteHat Jr student, and yes, I had to go through the trouble of looking at other sources and trying to understand everything by myself. Here, Stackoverflow saved me. But I want to reduce the burdon of newer students who are about to go through these classes. Thats why I made an archive which contains all of the current/older WhiteHat Jr advanced class projects.

## How Will This Help?
This might not directly help the new students by letting them copy-paste or reuse my code (but you can because this repo has the MIT License) but students can read through the code and test it with the VSCode [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension, so that they can get a clear understanding of the code.

## Some Of The Code Isn't Complete!
Some projects might not be fully complete because that's all the project assigned me at that time (or I'm straight-up lazy and I didn't complete it yet xd). if so, I will try completing it, and I will update it soon.

## The Code Is Complete But It's Not Working.
If you notice a bug in any of the projects, feel free to submit an [issue on Github](https://github.com/notsniped/whjr-archive/issues/new). I'll take a look at it, and if it's valid, I will fix it for you.

## Can I contribute?
If you're willing to help me make the code better, or just straight-up complete all of my incomplete projects, you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/notsniped/whjr-archive/compare) and I'll give it a look!

## Known Bugs
You tell me :)
