This is a repository made by notsniped (the founder of the [NKA Organization](https://github.com/PyBotDevs)) for WhiteHat Jr **Advanced** students to help them with their web coding projects.

## Why Do This?
I am a WhiteHat Jr student, and yes, I had to go through the trouble of looking at other sources and trying to understand everything by myself. Here, Stackoverflow saved me. But I want to reduce the burdon of newer students who are about to go through these classes. Thats why I made an archive which contains all of the current/older WhiteHat Jr advanced class projects.

## How Will This Help?
